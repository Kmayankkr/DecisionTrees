# DecisionTrees
CPP implementation of the ID3 algorithm for creating decision trees. Information Gain has been used as the attribute selector for performing subsequent node splits while building the decision tree. Post processing techniques applied - Rule post pruning, early stopping conditions to limit the height of the decision tree, feature-bagging to create multiple trees (Decision forests / Ensembles). The training dataset has also been uploaded to the repository.
